2/13 - started setting up github and looked into two projects with the guide of chatgpt. ( got tired of reading gibberish. )
lets see Spotifyd – The lightweight Spotify client (mostly for Linux/macOS) " i didin't realized that it wasint working for windows. 
Spicetify – A modding tool for the desktop Spotify client that can change themes, add extensions, etc.  ( APPARENTLY THE ADDING EXTENSIONS PART IS OUTDATED) ?????????? ugh 
soo there goes my day .  END - 8pm 

2/14 - man f**k chatgpt, tried to make a website to-do list, and tried to use ChatGpt to make it,  using it as a learning experience but instead, i learned that the AI is a bit 
mentally disabled. so when it comes to errors it just runs in circles on the "solutions it has", sometimes it works, Most of the time it DOESN't. - 4pm
