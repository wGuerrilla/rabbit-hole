2/13 - started setting up github and looked into two projects with the guide of chatgpt. ( got tired of reading gibberish. )
lets see Spotifyd – The lightweight Spotify client (mostly for Linux/macOS) " i didin't realized that it wasint working for windows. 
Spicetify – A modding tool for the desktop Spotify client that can change themes, add extensions, etc.  ( APPARENTLY THE ADDING EXTENSIONS PART IS OUTDATED) ?????????? ugh 
soo there goes my day .  END - 8pm 

2/14 - man f**k chatgpt, tried to make a website to-do list, and tried to use ChatGpt to make it,  using it as a learning experience but instead, i learned that the AI is a bit 
mentally disabled. so when it comes to errors it just runs in circles on the "solutions it has", sometimes it works, Most of the time it DOESN't. - 4pm 
soo i took a step back, defined my goals. now i am starting in the proccess of learning Git. continue tmr - 10pm

2/17 - ayoooo got my pacman game started (overDAweekends) but finally got the window to open :D umm lets see i spent alot of time today learning git.
commiting, saving, branching, merging, etc. i feel confortable using it. not badd.. tomorrow i plan to study more java. 
as in what each word and line of code does. in detail. idk why but i feel like getting excess information of just lets say Import javax.swing.JFrame -
what does it do, how does it work. yk helps me iguess.  ohhh i have some java homwework too. wtver im done for today. - 10:25pm 

2/18 - spent most of today working on College Assignments, throughout the day i was thinking alot about the pac-man game, idk i try my best to learn.. AI has helped me ALOT 
... Since you just feed it Books or any other resource, it gives you an Accurate (enough) solution. Althought im questioning my reliance on It. BUT. im new. so
im not gonna get exhausted making simple games. anyways i got weent back on the grid seing alot of details to be added. i DREW PACKMAN. allahhhh, idk but making PacMan 
it required some art skills. idk it was fun. got the loop and it looks nice :). started working on startScreen. its bare bones rn. but more work to come. - 10:55PM
